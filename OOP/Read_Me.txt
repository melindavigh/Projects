Author: Melinda VighDate: 7/14/2023Description: The BST_MelindaVigh_App is used to manipulate the BinarySearchTree_MelindaVigh binary search tree. The program reads information from a file (input.txt) and stores the Artwork_MelindaVigh objects into the binary search tree. Then proceeds to use inOrder Taversal to sort the artworks recursively based on the year the artwork was completed and storing the artworks in order into a fully developed queue (Queue_MelindaVigh). 	The user has the option to “add” or “remove” other Artwork_MelindaVigh objects to the binary search tree. They can also “search” if a specific artwork is already in the BST or not. After the user fully done and has inputted “done” then the program will resort the BST using inOrder traversal, store the sorted objects into a queue (Queue_MelindaVigh) before outputting the original sorted list (form input.txt) and the modified sorted list after adding and removing other objects into the output.txt file. Files included:                                     Java Files 1.
